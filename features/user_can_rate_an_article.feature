        Given the following article exist
        | title          | body                                                             | 
        | This is so sad | A recent report suggest that news are mostly sad. Which is sad.  |
        And the following user exists
        | email          | password    | role      |

        And I am logged in as 'pablo@test.com'
    
    Scenario:

        And I click on "This is so sad"
        Then I am on the "This is so sad" page
